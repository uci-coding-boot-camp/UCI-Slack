## UCI Slack Community Guidelines and Information

1. Privilege
  - Being part of the Slack UCI Alumni group is a privilege. This group was created to help alumni with jobs; create a positive environment for students to network with each other; and help students and graduates develop their skills further. Any negative behavior, complaining, or violation of the other rules can result in a ban at any time from the moderator(s). If you have an issue with someone, UCI Extension, or anything else, please contact your SSM or PM the mods in private. 
2. Respect and tolerance
  - Please avoid snarky or personally offensive commentary. We encourage lively debate and discussion, provided the conversation remains positive and constructive. We do not want anyone to feel intimidated or discouraged from participating.
3. Jobs on the Job Board
  - Please feel free to post job openings on the`#job-leads` channel
4. Events
  - Events can be fun and can be posted to the `#events` channel. If hosting an event, please make sure that it's inclusive and isn't meant to separate others.
5. Resources
  - The `#resources` channel is there to post resources that you think can help other UCI CBC members. The `#instructor-resources` is only for instructors to post resources in (vetted resources).
6. Topics and Concepts
  - The `#topics-and-concepts` channel is used to discuss different programming concepts and topics. Please keep this limited to just programming topics for now. 
7. Mentorship
  - One problem we've run into is students not having personal mentorship as they (you) grow into experienced developers. With the `#mentorship` channel, we can utilize graduates or even current students that have been successful in the program and afterwards. If you are inclined to help with mentorship, please let us know and we can add you as a mentor in the Mentorship channel.
